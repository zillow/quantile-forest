"""
Quantile regression forest of trees-based ensemble methods.

The module structure is the following:

- The ``BaseForestQuantileRegressor`` base class implements a common ``fit``
  method for all the estimators in the module. The ``fit`` method of the base
  class calls the ``fit`` method of the ``ForestRegressor`` and creates a
  quantile forest object that records the leaf node membership of all samples
  of the training set.

- The ``RandomForestQuantileRegressor`` derived class provides the user with a
  concrete implementation of the quantile regression forest ensemble method
  that extends the classical ``RandomForestRegressor`` as the estimator
  implementation.

- The ``ExtraTreesQuantileRegressor`` derived class provides the user with a
  concrete implementation of the quantile regression forest ensemble method
  that extends the extremely randomized trees ``ExtraTreesRegressor`` as the
  estimator implementation.

Only single output problems are handled.

            The quantile or list of quantiles that the model tries to predict.
            Each quantile must be strictly between 0 and 1. If "mean", the
            model predicts the mean. If None, the model uses the value of

            quantile lies between two data points ``i < j``:

            - If "linear", then ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
              is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i`` and
              ``j``.
            - If "lower", then ``i``.
            - If "higher", then ``j``.
            - If "nearest", then ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
            - If "midpoint", then ``(i + j) / 2``.

        weighted_quantile : bool, default=True
            Calculate a weighted quantile. Weighted quantiles are computed by
            assigning weights to each training sample, while unweighted
            quantiles are computed by aggregating sibling samples. When the
            number of training samples relative to siblings is small, weighted
            quantiles can be more efficient to compute than unweighted ones.

        weighted_leaves : bool, default=True
            Weight samples inversely to the size of their leaf node.
            Only used if `weighted_quantile=True` and `max_samples_leaf!=1`.

        aggregate_leaves_first : bool, default=True
            Calculate predictions using aggregated leaf values. If True, a
            single prediction is calculated over the aggregated leaf values.
            If False, a prediction is calculated for each leaf and aggregated.

        oob_score : bool, default=False
            Only use out-of-bag (OOB) samples to predict quantiles.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        indices : list, default=None
            List of training indices that correspond to X indices. An index of
            -1 can be used to specify rows omitted from the training set. By
            default, assumes all X indices correspond to all training indices.
            Only used if `oob_score=True`.

        duplicates : list of lists, default=None
            List of sets of functionally identical indices.
            Only used if `oob_score=True`.

        A quantile rank of, for example, 0.8 means that 80% of the scores in
        `inputs` are below the given score.

        In the case of gaps or ties, the exact definition depends on the
        optional keyword `kind`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            The input samples. Internally, its dtype will be converted to
            ``dtype=np.float32``. If a sparse matrix is provided, it will be
            converted into a sparse ``csr_matrix``.

        y : array-like of shape (n_samples)
            The target values for which to calculate ranks.

        kind : {"rank", "weak", "strict", "mean"}, default="rank"
            Specifies the interpretation of the resulting score:

            - If "rank", then average percentage ranking of score. If multiple
              matches, average the percentage rankings of all matching scores.
            - If "weak", then only values that are less than or equal to the
              provided score are counted. Corresponds to the definition of a
              cumulative distribution function.
            - If "strict", then similar to "weak", except that only values
              that are strictly less than the provided score are counted.
            - If "mean", then the average of the "weak" and "strict" scores.

        aggregate_leaves_first : bool, default=True
            Calculate quantile ranks using aggregated leaf values. If True, a
            single rank is calculated over the aggregated leaf values. If
            False, a rank is calculated for each leaf and aggregated.

        oob_score : bool, default=False
            Only use out-of-bag (OOB) samples to predict quantile ranks.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        indices : list, default=None
            List of training indices that correspond to X indices. An index of
            -1 can be used to specify rows omitted from the training set. By
            default, assumes all X indices correspond to all training indices.
            Only used if `oob_score=True`.

            List of sets of functionally identical indices.

    to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The
    sub-sample size is controlled with the `max_samples` parameter if
    `bootstrap=True` (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build
    each tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

    default_quantiles : float, list, or "mean", default=0.5
        The default quantile or list of quantiles that the model tries to
        predict. Each quantile must be strictly between 0 and 1. If "mean",
        the model predicts the mean.

    criterion : {"squared_error", "absolute_error", "poisson"}, \
            default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion, "absolute_error"
        for the mean absolute error, and "poisson" which uses reduction in
        Poisson deviance to find splits.
        Training using "absolute_error" is significantly slower
        than when using "squared_error".

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    max_samples_leaf : int, float or None, default=1
        The maximum number of samples permitted to be at a leaf node.

        - If int, then consider `max_samples_leaf` as the maximum number.
        - If float, then `max_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(max_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the maximum
          number of samples for each node.
        - If None then unlimited number of leaf samples.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"sqrt", "log2", None}, int or float, default=1.0
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `round(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_features=n_features`.

        .. note::
            The default of 1.0 is equivalent to bagged trees and more
            randomness can be achieved by setting smaller values, e.g. 0.3.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    bootstrap : bool, default=True
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        Only available if bootstrap=True.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed.

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_estimator_ : DecisionTreeRegressor
        The child estimator template used to create the collection of fitted
        sub-estimators.

class ExtraTreesQuantileRegressor(BaseForestQuantileRegressor):
    """An extra-trees regressor that provides quantile estimates.

    This class implements a meta estimator that fits a number of randomized
    decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples of the dataset
    and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control
    over-fitting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

    default_quantiles : float, list, or "mean", default=0.5
        The default quantile or list of quantiles that the model tries to
        predict. Each quantile must be strictly between 0 and 1. If "mean",
        the model predicts the mean.

    criterion : {"squared_error", "absolute_error"}, default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion, and "absolute_error"
        for the mean absolute error.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    max_samples_leaf : int, float or None, default=1
        The maximum number of samples permitted to be at a leaf node.

        - If int, then consider `max_samples_leaf` as the maximum number.
        - If float, then `max_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(max_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the maximum
          number of samples for each node.
        - If None then unlimited number of leaf samples.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"sqrt", "log2", None}, int or float, default=1.0
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `round(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_features=n_features`.

        .. note::
            The default of 1.0 is equivalent to bagged trees and more
            randomness can be achieved by setting smaller values, e.g. 0.3.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    bootstrap : bool, default=False
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        Only available if bootstrap=True.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls 3 sources of randomness:

        - the bootstrapping of the samples used when building trees
          (if ``bootstrap=True``)
        - the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best
          split at each node (if ``max_features < n_features``)
        - the draw of the splits for each of the `max_features`

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed.

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_estimator_ : ExtraTreeQuantileRegressor
        The child estimator template used to create the collection of fitted
        sub-estimators.

    estimators_ : list of ForestRegressor
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

        The impurity-based feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.

        total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
        known as the Gini importance.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
        high cardinality features (many unique values).

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs.

    oob_score_ : float
        Score of the training dataset obtained using an out-of-bag estimate.
        This attribute exists only when ``oob_score`` is True.

    oob_prediction_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Prediction computed with out-of-bag estimate on the training set.
        This attribute exists only when ``oob_score`` is True.
