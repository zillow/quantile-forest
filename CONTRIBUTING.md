# Contributions

Contributions are welcome, encouraged, and appreciated!

If you encounter any bugs while using the project, or believe there's a feature that would prove useful, feel free to [submit a new issue](https://github.com/zillow/quantile-forest/issues/new/choose).

All contributions, suggestions, and feedback you submitted are accepted under the [project's license](https://github.com/zillow/quantile-forest/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Submitting an Issue

[Issues](https://github.com/zillow/quantile-forest/issues) should be used to report problems with the package or any of its dependencies, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

When reporting bugs, please provide a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example), the version of the package, and the environment (e.g., Python version).

If you find an existing Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproducible example to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

## Submitting a Pull Request

[PRs](https://github.com/zillow/quantile-forest/pulls) are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement merged. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Address a single concern in the fewest number of changes possible.
- Include updated documentation.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g., a major release), it's generally best to first open an Issue to discuss your proposed changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

## Setting Up Your Environment

To contribute to the `quantile-forest` source code, start by forking and then cloning the repository (i.e. `git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/quantile-forest.git`)

Once inside the repository, to build and install the package, run:

```cmd
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python setup.py install
 ```

## Testing Your Changes

To execute unit tests from the `quantile-forest` repository, run:

```cmd
pytest quantile_forest -v
```

## Troubleshooting

If the build fails because SciPy is not installed, ensure OpenBLAS and LAPACK are available and accessible.

On macOS, run:

```cmd
brew install openblas
brew install lapack
export SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1
```

Then try rebuilding.
